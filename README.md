# Developing a Business System Using ReactJS and Flask
 In addition to the knowledge learned in school, I have explored and selected appropriate technologies to build the project. For instance, I used MySQL for database design and storage, Flask (Python) for building RESTful APIs, JWT (JSON Web Token) for user authentication, and Flask-CORS for connecting APIs to clients. Additionally, Socket.io is used for real-time message forwarding. On the frontend, ReactJS, Bootstrap 5, HTML, ChartJS 2, and Sparklines are employed to design the user interface. I also utilized development tools like PyCharm, MySQL, and Visual Studio Code to implement the current project.
